		<p>The purpose of this survey is for me to collect data on how users interact with my website redesign. This is purely a school assignment so nothing you do will have an effect and some links are dead (will not navigate you to a real page) please keep this in mind. However any feedback will help me to perfect my assignment.<br>Thank you for your time, <br>Samantha Miller</p>
