		<h1>Redesign of:</h1>
		<h2>Walter E. Baird Funeral Home INC.</h2>
		
		<h3>Site Intent</h3>
		<p>The intent of this redesign is to effectively use HTML5 to create more semantic meaning and CSS to appropriately style its sensitive content. To begin the sites content will be condensed and information that is not needed will be taken out of the site to reduce the amount of unnecessary and distracting content. A new color pallet and layout will be implemented to reflect the businesses trustworthiness and loyalty to future clients.</p> 
		
		<p>The current site has nine main navigation pages, this will be condensed into four navigation pages which will house most of the sites current content and stylized with current CSS standards. The Homepage will house a synopsis of the business, current obituaries and a calendar with upcoming calling hours and funerals. The about us page will house staff profiles as well as the history of the business as it has been family run and will help insure trust with future clients. The pre-need page will contain an updated HTML5 form and benefits of pre-planning and lastly and lastly the contact form which will house contact information, directions as well as services local businesses provide that are part of the funeral process.</p>
		
		<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
		<p>In comparison to the other funeral homes that compete for business with Baird's, Baird's has a more ascetically pleasing website. It seems that all the local funeral home sites are lacking in well designed websites so the redesign of Baird's could help them gain more of a market share in the small towns they are affiliated with.</p>
		<p>Keywords: Funeral Home, Dansville NY, Obituaries, Bachelor and Charlene.</p>
		
		
		<h3>Target Audience</h3>
		
		<h4>Primary Persona:</h4>
		<p>The primary target for the site are older people who are preparing for a loved ones passing. Most are older females trying to prepare for there husbands passing as men tend to pass earlier than women and there is generally enough time to get preliminary things out of the way such as headstone/coffin ordering before the person is deceased. The site needs to be friendly towards older demographics, less options, clear objectives.</p> 
		
		<h4>Secondary Persona:</h4>
		<p>The secondary target are that of the local community. They will utilize the site for looking at recent obituaries and looking for upcoming calling hour and funeral times. To optimize the site for these users ideally those will be featured on the sites homepage.</p>
