		<h1>Redesign of:</h1>
		<h2>Walter E. Baird Funeral Home INC.</h2>
		
		<h3>Site Intent</h3>
		<p>The intent of this redesign is to effectively use HTML5 to create more semantic meaning and CSS to appropriately style its sensitive content. To begin the sites content will be condensed and information that is not needed will be taken out of the site to reduce the amount of unnecessary and distracting content.</p> 
		
		<p>The current site has nine main navigation pages, this will be condensed into four navigation pages which will house most of the sites current content. The Homepage will house a synopsis of the business, current obituaries and a calendar with upcoming calling hours and funerals. The about us page will house staff profiles as well as the history of the business as it has been family run and will help insure trust with future clients. The pre-need page will contain the form and benefits of pre-planning and lastly and lastly the contact form which will house contact information, directions as well as services local businesses provide that are part of the funeral process.</p>
