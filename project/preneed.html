	<h2>Pre-planning your funeral make sense - </h2>

	<p>Pre-planning your funeral gives the individual or other family members an opportunity to discuss, select and if 			they wish to purchase a funeral service for themselves or a loved one. As in every aspect of our lives, we try and anticipate all possibilities.  We pre-plan for our weddings, for the birth of our children and yes, we should pre-plan for our deaths.  Discussing our options about or demise does not have to be depressing or intimidating.  It can and should be a conscious well thought out plan. Families have pre-planned their funeral wishes for years. This process can be as brief or as thorough as wish.  The Baird’s have been helping family’s pre-plan funerals, cremations or burials for generations.</p>
